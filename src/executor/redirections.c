Yes — that’s conceptually spot on! Let me walk through your steps and clarify a few points so it’s crystal clear:

Step-by-step interpretation

Copy std_direction (save original FD)

Useful if you want to restore the original stdin/stdout later.

In practice, you’d use dup(std_direction) to get a backup FD.

Check resource type

If resource_type indicates a file:

Cast void * to char * (filename).

Open the file with the given flags → this gives a new FD.

If resource_type indicates an already-open FD (pipe/heredoc):

Cast void * to int * or just take the int value directly.

dup2(resource_fd, std_direction)

This is the actual “rewire” step: replaces the target standard FD with your resource FD.

Optional: update std_direction variable

Not strictly necessary unless you’re keeping track of it elsewhere.

Close the original resource FD

Only if it’s a newly opened file.

For pipes or heredocs, only close if you no longer need that FD elsewhere.

✅ Key points

The helper now handles both files and FDs with a single interface.

Only one integer parameter for flags is needed — combine multiple flags with |.

Saving the original FD lets you restore it later if redirection is temporary.

The actual command doesn’t know anything about this — it just reads/writes to the standard FDs.

If you want, I can draw a visual flow diagram showing how rewire works for multiple redirections, including a file and a pipe together. This really makes the idea click.

rewire(void *resource, int resource_type, int std_direction, int flags)
{
    copy std_direction
    if file (else already have the fd)
        open file with flags and use that fd in next steps
    dup2 file
    set std_direction to file
    close file
}
    Here’s a clean way to conceptually design rewire in C so it can handle both filenames and already-open FDs without true overloading:

Idea

Use a flag parameter to tell rewire what kind of resource it’s dealing with.

Example: RESOURCE_FILE vs RESOURCE_FD

Parameters

Resource

If it’s a file, pass a char * (filename).

If it’s an FD (like a pipe), pass an int.

You can store it as a void * or union to keep one parameter.

Target FD

0, 1, or 2 for stdin/stdout/stderr.

Flags

Used only if it’s a file.

Ignored if the resource is already an FD.

Resource type flag

Indicates whether to interpret resource as a filename or FD.

Conceptual Flow

Check resource type:

If it’s a file → open it with the given flags.

If it’s an FD → just use it directly.

Save the original target FD (optional, for undoing later).

Duplicate the resource FD onto the target FD (dup2).

Close the original resource FD if it’s a file (not needed for already-open FDs if you still need them elsewhere).

Benefits

Single function handles all kinds of redirections.

Caller doesn’t need separate helpers for files vs pipes.

Clean interface:

rewire(resource, target_fd, flags, resource_type)


If you want, I can make a diagram showing how this handles multiple redirections and pipes so it’s easy to visualize how the FDs get rewired. Do you want me to do that?
